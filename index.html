                        Josh is a young professional working in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada. Starting as a basic sales associate, Josh has taken every opportunity to better himself and enter the 
                        world of web development. Starting with introductory courses to wordpress to help the small retail store he worked for better design their <a href="https:kbmoutdoors.ca" target="_blank">website</a>, he immediately
                        dove head-first into all the semicolons and less-then/greater-thans he could find. With that first website ever a work in progress Josh then took on the larger
                        <a href="https:kbm.ca" target="_blank">parent-company website</a> and began making changes to that.
                    </p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col">
                    <p>
                        Just one year later, Josh is the head of the company's small and growing 'web committee' and continues to strive to learn more and better the web presence of both
                        the larger site and the smaller first one. Currently, he is in the process of taking KBMOutdoors' website into the realm of E-commerce, developing a catalogue,
                        price list, integrated webstore and all the associated features.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to do all this in the most professional and efficient way, Josh has enrolled in the UofT SCS Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. Seeking to deepen his knowledge,
                        improve himself professionally, and better his mindset and experience personally, Josh will spend the coming months studying the ins and outs of html, css, javascript, and more
                        and use that information in real time to improve the websites he works on.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Josh is also a part-time video game streamer/youtube with affiliate status on twitch.tv. His channels feature "Let's Plays", competitive games, strategy games, 
                        creative games with community interaction, and a running segment called "#DLOM". DLOM stands for Downloaded or Outmoded and consists of Josh and sometimes friends playing
                        cheap indie games and giving them a thumbs up or thumbs down. Many broken, unplayable, "early access" garbage games are hammered through in a rapid-fire style for laughs and 
                        silliness. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another running joke is the song request feature. Several prominent community members love to torture Josh with a collection of the least bearable 'music' from around the internet.
                        Anything goes and the name of the game is "make josh lose his mind" - which he usually eventually does. If you've never heard a 1-hour version of Thomas the Tank Engine mashed up
                        with Notorious B.I.G.'s "Muthaf*ckas" you just can't appreciate the level of troll.
